Dice Game generates a random dice side each time the user refreshed the webpage. 
It can be used as a simple way to decide the winner between two groups.

The skeleton HTML and CSS was pre-written by AppBrewery and I wrote the JavaScript
as part of an exercise in their Web Development Bootcamp. I also made minor edits
to the CSS.
